        <p>
          As stated last chapter, the road to our taken-for-granted worker's
          rights we whitewashed and demphasized in today's society. Many battles
          were campaigned and fough for, some peaceful and through legal means, other
          through blood and armed confrontations.
          In this chapter, I will focus on the United States and it's bloody history.

        <h2>A Chicago Headline!</h2>
        <div class="preface-card image">
          <div>
            <p>
              In the proud and windy midwest city of Chicago, happened one of the first
              bloodiest worker's strike in America. The Pullman Strike of 1894 started
              because the Pullman Company laid off workers, lowered wages, but refused
              to give the workers' any semblance of Democracy, cut excessive gas and
              water rates, and had a strong dictatorial presence over the workers.
              It did not help by the fact that the workers lived in Company Towns,
              and so was in all other means controlled and managed by the company.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workers, led by Eugene Debs (later co-founder of the Socialist Party of America)
              founded the American Railway Union, and went on a wildcat strike (a state unauthorized/unrecognized strike).
              The union called for a boycott on all trains that had Pullman cars, which affected most rail west of Detroit,
              and involved around 250,000 workers in 27 states. The strike and riots was so large that other unions (especially the AFL)
              opposed it. Sabotage, riots, and burnings racked up a debt of $80 million dollars worth of damage, and 30 people were killed.
              The Federal Government, filed an injuction against the strikers, but was ultimately ignored, leading to thousands of
              US Marshals and 12,000 United States Army infantry to quell the strike in Chicago. this caused violence to escalate,
              and on July 7th, 1894, after scuffles broke out between US infantrymen and strikers, the National Guard shot into the crowd,
              and 4-30 people were found dead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Public Opinion by that point had long turned sour, and Eugene Debs was sent to prison for 6 months.
              However, this strike resulted in the establishment of the American Labor Day on September 1st, and forced Pullman
              to handover it's town to the City of Chicago, it is now a Chicago Landmark District.

        <h2>A Coal-d Strike</h2>
        <p>
          The United Mine Workers of America (UMCA) had experience from organizing unions since 1897,
          and in 1900, found that ogliopoly was formed in the coals mines of Nanticoke, Pennsylvannia.
          The comapnies refued to cooperate nor acknowledge the union, but conceeded with a wage increase
          during a strike in 1900. In 1902, the Pennsylvannia and Reading Railroad refused to a compromise
          in regards to the supervision of working conditions. (The UMCA wanted clergymen to report on conditions)
          This failed and on May 12, 1902, 100,000 workers either went on strike, or left for greener pastures.
          However
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, it should be noted the companies were alleged to ignore and break child labor laws, as noted by Francis H. Nichols
          in Children of the Coal Shadow. In addition, most of the children and spouses of the miners had to scrape by
          because the town was a "Company Town". Funnily enough, the children there formed their own unions and became "Kickers",
          in large part from the influences of their pro-union or union parents. Maybe we should form our own student unions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately President Theodore Roosevelt was a progressive, he tried to bring a compromise between the union and the company.
          But he was advised against by his own Attorney General, but winter was coming (this was a coal mine), and public support for
          the strikers was fairly high. By that point, the Pennsylvannian National Guard was sent in to protect "scabs" (workers who
          don't stand in solidarity with the strikers). Roosevelt attempted to convince the union to a compromise, but ultimately failed.
          J.P Morgan, an American business tycoon, was urged by the Secretary of War (Secretary of Defense) to form a committee to
          investigate working conditions. In the end, it ruled in sligth favor of the union and was possibly the start of unions
          to turn to moderatism.

        <h2>The Cold War in Colorado</h2>
        <p>The longest in my project :Q</p>
        <div class="preface-card image">

            <p>
              The Colorado Labor Wars of 1903-1904 was a series of violent strikes between the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) and
              "Employer Associations" and the Colorado State Government. Before this, the Cripple Creek strike of 1894 was one of the first
              confrontations between the WFM and the mine owners. The mine owners raised the work hours without raising pay, causing a strike
              to break out, the owners in result brought in 1,200 strike breakers. Both sides were well armed and prepared for a confrontation.
              However, the Governer of Colorado, Davis Waite, convinced both sides in favor of the union workers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1903, conservative elements of Coloradan society and corporate interests elected a pro-business Republican.
              The newly inaugurated Governer James Peabody promised to make Colorado "Safe for Investments.". In coinciding with earlier,
              employers themselves started their own associations or unions. Pinkerton spies commonly monitored union members on behalf of the
              companies as well. In comparison, frustrations of the WFM and the state government led to the WFM in adopting (Revolutionary) Socialism.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fruits for bloodshed started when the Coloradan Lesgislature refused to acknowledge to vote on an 8-hour work day, despite a state referendum
              in which 72% of the population voted in favor of it, and a constitutional amendment for the Coloradan Supreme Court to be satisfied. A strike in
              Idaho Springs in 1903 was started to push for an 8-hour work day. 2 months into the strike, the striking miners attempted to blow up a powerhouse
              in one of the strike breaker's (commonly referred to as scabs) housing units. However, one of the strikers died in a pre-mature blast. Union officials
              were arrested that night under suspicions. Interestingly enough, pro-employer people under the "Citizen's Protection League" removed the union members
              and exiled them from town. A strike at the Durango Smelter failed due to the hirement of scabs. Another incident occured when a Pinkerton spy caused
              42 miners to be fired for simply joining a union, a strike was called in and the state government deployed the Colorado Nation Guard despite protests
              and objections by Colorado-City City-Officials. The National Guard dispersed union pickets and searched their homes. Various other strikes occured at this
              era but weren't as severe. The most severe strike however, occured in August of 1903, when the WFM in attempt to force mills to the negotiation table
              forcibly started strikes in associated mines, unfortunately, the strike was done counter to democratic norms and was opposed by up to 90% of WFM miners.
              The reason for the WFM's desition was that they followed "Industrial Unionism", where all union members in an Industry collectivize in solidarity with
              each other. A sort of cold war existed between WFM influenced areas and Cripple Creek Mine Owner's Association (CCMOA) influenced areas. Merchants by then
              refused to do business there. The sheriff of Cripple Creek was a WFM member, and deputized guards at mines although faced dismay by the mine owners.
            </p>
            <p>
              After an investigation by the Governer of Colorado, he intervened in support of the CCMOA and deployed 1000 National Guardsmen. It was protested
              by the populus. The general in charge of the battalion or so was an avowed de-facto miltarist, with qoutes such as "To hell with the constitution, we aren't
              going by the constitution.", and "Habeas corpus be damned, we'll give 'em post mortems." The National Guard began suppresing and arresting anyone with
              seemingly pro-union sympathies. Any journalist in support of the strikers were temporarily detained. When several arrested union members were brought to court,
              the National Guard escorted them armed into the courtroom, and remained armed and in formation whilst inside the chamber. Some soldiers outside setup a machine gun
              post and some took up sniper duties. In face of intimidation, an attorney for the prisoners left in protest, but the Judge ruled in favor of the prisoners while
              commenting, "I trust that there will never again be such an unseemly and unnecessary intrusion of armed soldiers in the halls and about the entrances of
              American Courts of Justice. They are intrusions that can only tend to bring this court into contempt, and make doubtful the boasts of that liberty that is the keynote
              of American Government.". In spite of the court ruling, the National Guard refused to comply until the Governer ordered them to do so. Mine owners hired scabs
              with them under the impression that they were permanent work, not as a replacement in strikes. Those who were hired were practically forced to work despite the strikes.
              One notable example was when a scab miner named Emil Peterson immediately left when he found out that the workers at the mine were striking, when he ran an officer
              shot at him, the officer was never arrested despite a warrant.
            </p>
            <p>
              A WFM member was bribed by Pinkertons to pull the spikes of a traintrack where Victor's Mine Union leaders and men were supposed to travel on that day. The offending
              member, McKinney, released 2 confessions, the first one implicated Union leaders and the WFm, while his 2nd confession contradicts the first by saying that he was payed
              a pardon, immunity, $1000, and the abiltity for him and his wife to travel the world by lying who pulled them, as he himself didn't know who. McKinney ultimately stuck
              to his first confession and said that his 2nd was false. He was granted unusual privileges as he was allowed to visit his wife. One of the Pinkertons admitted to trying
              to get WFM members to pull the spike, in order to create the conditions to condemn the WFM. The jury found the WFM members non-guiilty. The Pinkertons were never arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
              A strike occured in September 1903, where WFM members, armed, struck for an 8-hour workday. The Governer asked for US Army infrantrymen, but President Roosevelt refused.
              He later settled for 500 Colorado National Guardsmen. Deputity Sheriffs attempted to disarm the union members, but they refused, in response, the deputies started
              arresting any striking members for vagrancy. The charges would later be dropped, and released from jails a mere 71 miles only.
            </p>
            <p>
              A WFM member, Harry Orchard, confessed to causing an explosion at Vindicator Mine, despite the areas being heavily fotified and guard by the National Guard. The explosion
              killed 2 management employees of the mine. Both sides (WFM and CCMOA) accused each other of the bomb, the National Guard increased it's harrassment of union members,
              and started arresting children who annoyed the soldiers, and and the governer delcared martial law. The Bill of Rights was suspended, prisoners who won Habeas Corpus cases
              were rearrested, people who refused to give up arms faced the risk of getting shot, and freedoms of assembly and speech was surpressed. It was alleged that the explosion
              was caused by the mine owners to prolong the National Guard's deployment. Harray Orchard, also confessed to pulling the spikes (as mentioned 2 paragraphs ago), while also
              implicating WFM leadersip, this is in contradiction with the jury and evidence involved in the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final blow to the WFM occured on June 6th, 1904, when an explosion happened at the Independence Train Depot, taking 13 with it. The CCMOA and allied groups
              vowed to forcibly remove all non-supportive officials. They forced the sheriff to resign immediately, or face a lynching. CCMOA later held a rally across WFM
              headquarters, this caused a firefight to occur between pro-CCMOA miltias (with National Guard support), and WFM miners. All mine management employees were deuptized the
              night of the explosion, and hunted all union mumbers they could find. The found and hunted were barred from food, until the Women's Auxillary were allowed to. Those
              arrested would be deported across state lines via kangaroo courts.

            <p>
              The Colorado Coalfield War of 1913-1914, infamous for being the US's most bloodiest labor strike ever.
              In 1903, the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I) was taken over by a group supported by John D. Rockefeller.
              Under his tenure, working conditions dropped dramtically, and death rates were twice the average there.
              And despite Federal concerns, nothing ever changed at the mines. Labor spying was also commonplace, and only
              increased after the 1903-1904 strikes. Because CF&I didn't comply with new labor regulations, the workers went on strike.
              Forces allied with CF&I hired private detectives, and then-Governer (of Colorado) Elis Ammons deployed the National Guard.
              The detectives then murdered a United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) organizer 5 weeks prior to the strikes. Oddly enough,
              the CF&I had an armored car named "Death Special", which was equipped with around 9 machine guns and was to fire into the miners'
              colonies. Both sides then started an arms race.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the first strike occured, a peak of 20,000 went on strike and evicted from their homes, they would later be housed in tents,
              although some came late, and those who didn't have tents had to live under their furniture However, violence would start on September 24, 1913, in where
              a generally disliked CF&I marshal was ambushed and killed. CF&I-aligned militias shot from a route that connected Front Range and
              got 0 casualties. On October 9, 1913, a string miner-turned-rancher was shot dead by CF&I guards on patrol. This caused an arms race.
              While escorting a family of a scab, deputies fired into a crowd of strikers, killing 3 foreign miners. Greek miners would later assemble to
              ambush a military train due to them fearing the National Guard. Soon later, UMWA strikers would start harassing, ambushing, and attacking scabs and
              CF&I-aligned forces. On January 11 of 1914, a famed labor activist, Mother Jones, was arrested and detained at a hospital for 9 months, strikers
              tried and failed to free her. On January 14, 1914, an unexploded bomb was found in the National Guards' camp. Several UMWA members were arrested.
              Thanks to military intimidation and Greek union leaders (<i>AN: really Wikipedia?</i>), the strikes became peaceful. But National Guard officers were concered
              that one of their men was directly causing confrontation with the UMWA strikers. Lt. Linderfelt, was accused of hitting a striker for failing to
              disclose the location of a child. The National Guard denied the claim, but raised concerns over how the Lieutenant talked to the boy, in where he
              said, "I am Jesus Christ, and my men on horses are Jesus Christs, and we must be obeyed.". A scab was found dead on March 8, 1914, at a time when
              a congresional comittee was on tour the the body's general vicinity. The National Guard later burned down a striker camp and accidently killed 2
              newborn infants.
            </p>
            <p>
              On April 20, 1914, tensions peaked when Louis Tikos, the leader of the strikers, was summoned by the National guard,
              and both the UMWA and the National Guard took entrenchments. The first shots rang out, and Tikas was found shot in the back of the head.
              A twelve-year old was shot in the head and had his brain blown out, an and National Guard private was shot in the neck.
              18 UMWA casaulties were suffered. The UMWA would declare war, and violent conflicts occured between pro-Union forces and pro-CF&I forces.
              There are too many conflicts to be mentioned here, but fighting lasted until the Union ran out of funds in 1914. The Union agreed to an unconditional surrender
              with the US Federal Government serving as an intermediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lt. Linderfelt and Major Patrick Hamrock were charged in independent court-martials assault and suppresion of the strikes.
              Several UMWA members had their convictions overturned, and the UMWA bought a 40-acre large land to build a monument commerating the strikes.
