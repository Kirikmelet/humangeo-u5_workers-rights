        <h2>Origins of Labor Unions and Workers' Rights</h2>
        <p>
          The history of Labor Unions have been marred with violence and
          struggle. But that doesn't mean they haven't done good for us.

        <h2>A Long and Proud History</h2>
        <p>
          Within Britain existed a law called 'The Ordinance of Labourers' enacted
          in the Kingdom of England, 1349. This basically outlawed collective bargaining
          in unity. the Royal government would later specifically surpress labor unions
          with the 18th/19th century "Combination Acts", of which banned the organization
          of labor unions and forced them underground. Only was it due to public
          pressure and strikes that the government reallow the existance of labor unions.
          The idea of trade unions later spread among the industrialized or
          industrializing western powers. The gains of unions will be discussed in chapter 3.

        <h2>Spread and History of the Labor Unions in the United States</h2>
        <p>
          Labor Unions later spread from it's European Core and started to pop up
          in countries like our dear United States. One notable court case in the US
          in regards to early labor unions was held in March 1842 (Commonwealth vs. Hunt). Where the court
          rules that collective was in of itself illegal but that unions were legal.
          This lead to a rise in labor unions across the US. <br>
          A couple famed and well-known unions were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the Knights of Labor</li>
          <li>the American Federation of Labor</li>
          <li>the Western Federation of Labor</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="trivia">
          Guess which still exists today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Labor was at it's peak, and it's most violent during the early-mid 20th century.
          At this time, the bottom 40% owned a mighty less than 0% of the nation's wealth.
          (in comparison of the wealthiest 1% owning a meager portion of 51% of the
          national wealth) Labor strikes often turned violent and deadly, culminating
          in armed firefights between striking workers and local/state authorities.
          The bloodiest portion of this labor period will be explored in chapter 2.
          Needless to say, many Socialist, Communist, Anarchist, and including
          Progressive organizations/groups/unions sprung up. And after Soviet
          victory in the Russian Civil War (1918-1922), the (1st) Red Scare caused
          some to be supppresed. <br>
          Nevertheless, these groups include:
        </p>
        <ul> <!-- These exist within the years of 1900-1945 -->
          <!-- Parties or factions -->
          <li>the Socialist Party of America</li>
          <li>the Communist Party USA</li>
          <li>The Socialist Worker's Party</li>
          <li>the New Deal Democrats (FDR's wing of the Democratic Party)</li>
          <li>the Progressive Party</li>
          <li>the Social Democracy of America</li>
          <li>the Social Democratic Party of America></li>
          <li>the Farmer–Labor Party</li>
          <li>the Socialist Labor Party of America</li>
          <!-- Unions go below -->
          <li>the Industrial Workers of the World</li>
          <li>the International Brotherhood of Teamsters</li>
          <li>the Laborers' International Union of North America</li>
          <li>the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees</li>
          <li>the Transport Workers Union of America</li>
          <li>the United Auto Workers</li>
          <li>the United Steelworkers</li>
          <li>the American Federation of Government Employees</li>
          <li>the American Federation of Teachers</li>
          <li>the Trade Union Unity League</li>
          <li>the Western Federation of Miners</li>
          <li>et cetera...</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="trivia">
          Except the Democratic Party, guess which party was the oldest, and which
          unions was the oldest?
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Great Depression of 1929(-1936), the power of the Labor Movement
          was at it's highest ever, and then-President Franklin Deleano Roosevelt
          was arguably the US' most pro-labor president. Under his presidency several things
          were either signed into law or were suggested. <br>
          These laws include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the New Deal</li>
          <li>the National Labor Relations Act of 1935</li>
          <li>the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933</li>
          <li>the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938</li>
          <li>the Securities Act of 1933</li>
          <li>the Social Security Act of 1935</li>
          <li>the Davis–Bacon Act of 1931</li>
          <li>the Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936</li>
          <li>the Securities Exchange Act of 1934</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, following the post-war era and into the cold war, the (2nd) Red Scare and general apathy
          among the populus, caused some labor laws to be rolled back.
