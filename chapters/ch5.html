        <h2>The Modern Labor Movement and What We Can Do Today</h2>
        <p>
          Needless to say, the labor movement isn't as strong as it was
          decades ago. While many of the points demanded were fufilled
          to some extant, these still face repealment, and large tech
          companies are hostile to unions. If we want to help defend
          worker's right, and maybe push for more rights, we should be more
          active in the community, and <b>Join a Union!</b>

        <h2>A Summary of the Project</h2>
        <p>
          Unions have formed an integral part of American society. Else without
          them we wouldn't have the worker's rights we enjoy today. A couple of
          the oldest unions in America still exist today. The road to labor rights
          was marked by violence and death. A multitude of casualties were recorded
          in strikes that turned deadly between the state and the union. While the legacy
          of programs made to support labor unions and enfore labor rights stand strong,
          a couple were either pulled back or reversed. We can still strengthen labor unions
          and wrangle more reforms from the government.
