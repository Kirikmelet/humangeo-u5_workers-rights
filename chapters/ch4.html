          With all the gains of the historical labor movement, we should take a step back
          and see where the old movements and laws went.

        <h2>The New Deal</h2>
        <p>
          The New Deal enacted by President Franklin Delanor Roosevelt was an important law that brought
          many labor reforms and helped end the Great Depression. It brought with it many things we now consider
          expected in American society. <br>Such as:
        </p>
        <ul id="newDealProgs">
        </ul>
        <p>
          While some in the list aren't directly connected to worker's rights, they do however reinforce the status and rights
          workers have in society. New Deal-style policies had persisted until Reagan's Presidency, whom started to re-privatize
          and lifted regulations designed to benifit common people. Under Reagan, the Professional Air Traffic Controls Organization
          went on a strike, but because it forbade Federal Law, was promptly shut down, and sparked the beginning of the decline
          in union membership.

        <h2>Where The Unions Be?</h2>
        <p>
          During the Cold War, most left-wing unions faded into obscurity,
          however some do still exist today. Moderate unions like the AFL-CIO
          still exist and are still kicking today. However, anti-communism
          and "Right To Work Laws" have diminished the power and recruitment of unions.
          Membership of unions have decreased from 20% of all worker's in 1983 to around 13%.
          While public-sector union membership increased, private sector unions
          decreased quickly. Large companies like Amazon, Tesla, Google, discourage
          union drives and regularly intimidate and post anti-union propaganda.
